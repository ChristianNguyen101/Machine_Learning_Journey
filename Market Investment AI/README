This project is intended for educational purposes only. Do NOT utilize this code to conduct live trading. I adapted this project to learn about how local code can interface with other API.
This project serves to provide experience in accessing and utilizing dynamic datasets for machine learning purposes. 
I do not on this code or any of the rights associated with it. I have simply posted my progress and edits. I hope to post an update of the Alpaca account as the code runs.
