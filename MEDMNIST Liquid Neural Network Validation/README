I DID NOT write this code, nor did I come up with the ideas for this project. All rights belong to safipatel and his cited resources. 
This folder contains the changes to the liquid neural network code created by safipatel https://github.com/safipatel. Please utilize his github for the original source code. 

Presented here are the modifications of Safi Patel's Liquid Neural Network Architecture validating the results generated by his study in the breast tissue dataset and exploring the pneumonia and blood cell datasets. 
I chose to investigate the pneumonia and blood cell datasets due to there relatively small dataset size. 
The pneumonia data set has an output class size of 2 (pneumonia and no pneumonia) and the blood cell dataset has an 8 (neutrophil, eosinophil, basophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, immature granulocyte, erythroblast, and platelets). 
When editing the model to study these datasets, the pneumonia dataset requires changes to lines 34-36 and line 199 in the training script (identifying the dataset). 
For the blood cell dataset, line 22 should be changed to self.conv1 =  nn.Conv2d(3,16,3) in the models script to account for the change in input channels. 
In the training script, line 22 should be changed to 8 in addition to the changes in lines 34-36 and line 199 in the training script (identifying the dataset).  

The data found in this folder demonstrates that Safi Patel's Liquid Neural Network has functionality in the MEDMNIST dataset outside of the breast tissue dataset, including datasets with multi-class outputs. 
The next stage in this validation is to attempt utilizing data outside of the MEDMNIST dataset to identify if the dataset yields similar results. Another step in this validation is to compare DNNs to the LNNs as demonstrated in Safi Patel's repo and running the saved LNN model.


Note that I did not utilize Safi Patel's saved LNN model 898509. The data generated is from a newly run LNN. The LNN was run in Anaconda Spyder in the NPC environment with initial dependencies (npcs, torch, torchvision, tqdm, and medmnist). 
This data can be run on cpu at a rate of ~ 1 min per epoch.
